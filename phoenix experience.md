<!-- Objective
A PhD-level Electrical Engineer with extensive research in RF and satellite communications, now re-entering the modern engineering field. I am seeking project-based contracts where I can apply my foundational knowledge, refresh my practical skills, and contribute to a team's success. My goal is to expand my practical engineering skills while contributing to meaningful projects as a dedicated contractor.

Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging my deep theoretical understanding to serve as a mentor or teacher. I am actively seeking opportunities to develop training materials, lead educational sessions, or guide junior team members in complex topics such as Electromagnetics, RF/Microwave engineering, mathematics, and physics. -->

<!-- About me

Adaptable to old and new responsibilities. I am a  talented student and a hard-working person. I got my  Bachelor degree and Master degree at the University of  Arkansas - United States of America. I really enjoyed our  student life and volunteered for many organizations such  as American Red Cross, International Amnesty and  honor society such as Gamma Beta Phi and IEEE. I love  making friends, learning new cultures, getting to know
 each other and forming an international team. Therefore,  I worked with the International Culture Team to be a  Cross Culture Mentor to help freshman and undergrad students from all over the world to be a part of our Arkansas Razorback spirit. With this position, I taught international students about our school the U of A, our state Arkansas, the USA, as well as American cultures and Asian American cultures. Later on, I enrolled for BYU Pathways Online to be a cashier/ salesman/ businessman. At the beginning, I worked for various restaurant companies such as L&L Hawaiian BBQ, Arby’s, Costa Vida, Little Caesars, Denny’s as server, line cook, host and cashier. Later on, I was a parts sale manager at
 AutoZone then became a lead shift who assisted the store manager with all the sales and management tasks.

 However, life has recently some twists and turns which makes me back to Vietnam. I am sincere, hard working, good at trouble solving, customer service, computer skills and cash handling. I would love to be a part of the company and the team. -->
